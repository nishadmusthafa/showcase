# Talkdesk Tech Challenge

This repository contains the description of various problems that have
come up while working on Talkdesk.

Now that we have got a better appreciation of who you are, we would now like to get
a feel for the way you work. To do this, we would like you to collaborate with us on
solving a problem that we've encountered before.

Please understand that this is not a test or an exam, here there are no right and wrong
answers. This is just an opportunity for us to collaborate together and solve an interesting
problem. You also can get an understanding of the type of things we have to do in Talkdesk,
being a startup and all.

What we expect to learn about you from this is:

* Your working style
* How you think and solve problems
* How you communicate

And what we expect you'll learn about us is:

* How we work as a team
* The types of problems we deal with


## Next Steps

1. Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/Talkdesk/tech_challenge/wiki) and choose a problem to solve
2. Fork this repository
3. Open an Issue in your new repo with the problem you've chosen (can be used to discuss, ask questions, etc)
4. Solve the problem any way you like, but take into account our Development practices.
   This means use whatever tools, gems, etc. you need to get the job done. We also use github to collaborate
   so use it in which ever way you like.
5. Update your repository's README.md file so that it can give a small overview of how you solved the problem you
   chose. This will also help us navigate the code while reviewing :)
6. Have fun!

### During Development

As is mentioned in the Development Practices, you should be doing the development of this in a topic branch.
Once you have something in your branch, you can open a Pull Request (to your own master branch) any time you
like. You can use this pull request to discuss something code specific, or if you'd like some feedback on
your code.

If you have any problems or questions, just open an issue in your repository, someone will get back to you
about it. (If it's something quick, you can use [this HipChat channel](http://www.hipchat.com/gP8zhqbmd).)

Once you have something more substantial to show, make sure you have a pull request open so that a code review
can be performed within it.

*Note*: The git branch [basic-setup][1] contains a basic Ruby project setup that you can use if you like.
